 germany.4.a:0 "How can anyone say that Austria is not German?!"
 germany.5.t:0 "Anti-Comintern Pact"
 germany.5.d:0 "Germany proposes that we sign a pact recognizing that the aim of the Communist International, known as the Comintern, is to disintegrate and subdue existing States by all the means at its command; convinced that the toleration of interference by the Communist International in the internal affairs of the nations not only endangers their internal peace and social well-being, but is also a menace to the peace of the world desirous of co-operating in the defense against Communist subversive activities."
 germany.5.a:0 "Join"
 germany.5.b:0 "Refuse"
 germany.6.t:0 "The Tripartite Pact"
 germany.6.d:0 "The signees consider it as the condition precedent of any lasting peace that all nations in the world be given each its own proper place, have decided to stand by and co-operate with one another in their efforts in Greater East Asia and the regions of Europe respectively wherein it is their prime purpose to establish and maintain a new order of things, calculated to promote the mutual prosperity and welfare of the peoples concerned."

 germany.11.t:0 "The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"
 germany.11.d:0 "The German Foreign Ministry have proposed a non-aggression pact between our two nations. This treaty will greatly increase our mutual trade, and an additional secret protocol suggests the division of Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres.\n\nWhile the fascists in Berlin may not be trustworthy, this pact will allow us to deal with Finland, the Baltic States and Romania without fear of outside interference. The eastern territories of Poland will also befall us in the event of a Polish collapse."
 germany.11.a:0 "Sign the treaty."
 germany.11.a.tt:0 "§RWhile the pact is in effect, the Closed Economy trade policy will be unavailable.\nThe War With Germany focus will be unavailable for two years.§!\n"
 germany.11.b:0 "No deals with the fascists!"
 germany.12.t:0 "Moscow Signs the Pact"
 germany.12.d:0 "The Soviet Union has wisely agreed to sign our non-aggression pact. This means that we are free to act without risk of Soviet intervention.\n\nUnfortunately, some of our friends now question Germany's commitment towards the ultimate destruction of communism. When matters with Poland and France have been settled, we may need to revisit this treaty, but that is a discussion for another time..."
 germany.12.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.13.t:0 "Moscow Rejects the Pact"
 germany.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union has refused to sign our non-aggression pact! This complicates matters, since we cannot deal decisively with Poland or France without the risk of the Bolsheviks getting themselves involved."
 germany.13.a:0 "Curse them!"
 germany.14.t:0 "The Partitioning of Poland"
 germany.14.d:0 "Poland is ours, but the eastern parts fall under the Soviet sphere of influence according to the stipulations of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Should we withdraw our forces and let the Soviets occupy this territory? Failure to do so would render our treaty void."
 germany.14.a:0 "Yes. Treaty stipulations must be obeyed."
 germany.14.b:0 "No! All of Poland belongs to the Vaterland!"
 germany.15.t:0 "Germany Honors the Pact"
 germany.15.d:0 "In accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, German forces have evacuated eastern Poland and our own troops have moved in to occupy the territory."
 germany.16.t:0 "Germany Betrays the Pact"
 germany.16.d:0 "Germany has refused to partition Poland with us, in a blatant violation of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact! This betrayal has rendered our treaty with them null and void!"
 germany.16.a:0 "We were fools to trust the fascists!"
 germany.20.t:0 "Second Vienna Award"
 germany.20.d:0 "Recognizing that a new order has been established in Europe, we have been asked by Hungary and Romania to arbitrate in a territorial dispute between the two countries. Transylvania was taken from Hungary and incorporated into Romania in one of the many ill-conceived changes forced upon the world at Versailles. Should Northern Transylvania be returned to Hungarian control?"
 germany.20.a:0 "Give Hungary Northern Transylvania."
 germany.20.b:0 "Give Hungary all of Transylvania."
 germany.20.c:0 "Transylvania shall remain in Romania."
 germany.21.t:0 "Romania Rejects Our Verdict"
 germany.21.d:0 "Romania has refused to abide by the decision we reached in the Second Vienna Award! Their delegation has been recalled to Bucharest, and no territory has been surrendered to Hungary."
 germany.21.a:0 "The will of Germany must be obeyed!"
 germany.22.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Folds"
 germany.22.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has agreed to our demands, and Memel will be incorporated back into East Prussia. Yet another unlawfully stolen province has been returned to the German nation!"
 germany.22.a:0 "Excellent."
 germany.23.t:0 "Memel - Lithuania Refuses Demand"
 germany.23.d:0 "The Lithuanian government has refused our demands! They are hiding behind the Klaipeda Convention, claiming that Germany has no legal right to the Memel territory. We shall have to explain our position to them by different means..."
 germany.23.a:0 "Stubborn fools."
 germany.24.t:0 "German Military Mission to China"
 germany.24.d:0 "Germany has enjoyed good relations with China since the end of the previous Weltkrieg, despite the loss of our Chinese possessions. A German military mission has been present in China for a number of years, and Alexander von Falkenhausen has made great progress in reforming parts of the Kuomintang army.\n\nThis is naturally of some concern to the Japanese, given their present war against China. They are demanding the immediate withdrawal of all German support to the Chinese."
 germany.24.a:0 "Recall von Falkenhausen."
 germany.24.b:0 "No, our advisors will stay."
 germany.25.t:0 "Military Advisors Recalled"
 germany.25.d:0 "Deteriorating relations with China has made it politically unfeasible to maintain a military mission in their country. Alexander von Falkenhausen and the rest of our advisors have been recalled."
 germany.25.a:0 "We shall put him to work."
 germany.26.t:0 "China Detains Military Advisors"
 germany.26.d:0 "Germany and China are in a state of war, and the Chinese have consequently detained the German military advisors that reforming their army. Von Falkenhausen and a few of his officers managed to elude capture, and are now on their way back to Europe."
 germany.26.a:0 "Good man!"
 germany.27.t:0 "Fortifying the Westwall"
 germany.27.d:0 "Army pioneers have finished their survey of our existing fortifications, and identified the locations where they should be strengthened. The necessary construction orders have been placed."
 germany.27.a:0 "This will hold better than the Siegfried Line."
 germany.28.t:0 "Germans press for Anschluss"
 germany.28.d:0 "Civil unrest and acts of violence have broken out as protesters voice their desire for Austria to join Germany in a union of German peoples. Berlin is pressing hard for an Anschluss, which would see Austria annexed into their nation."
 germany.28.a:0 "We shall join the German Reich!"
 germany.28.b:0 "No, Austria's destiny lies elsewhere."
 germany.29.t:0 "Austria refuses the Anschluss!"
 germany.29.d:0 "The fools in Vienna have refused to accept the merger of our two nations! This is a blatant disregard for the will of the Austrian people, and it will not stand! We may have to enforce the Anschluss through military means."
 germany.29.a:0 "We must prepare for a military intervention."
 germany.40.t:0 "The Munich Conference"
 germany.40.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis. What will the British position be?"
 germany.40.d_2:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. As we have already proven that we won't accept German expansionism, this means we now have another ally in the war against Germany."
 germany.40.a:0 "The Czechs are on their own."
 germany.40.b:0 "Czechoslovakia must be defended!"
 germany.41.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have made it clear that they have no intention of going to war over a 'quarrel in a far-away country.' Should we follow their lead, or will we honor our obligations to Czechoslovakia by offering them support?"
 germany.41.a:0 "Leave the Czechs to their fate."
 germany.41.b:0 "The British be damned! France supports her friends!"
 germany.42.d:0 "German demands for the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia, where a significant number of ethnic Germans live, have come to a head. [GER.GetLeader] has positioned forces along the Czechoslovakian border in preparation for an attack. Talks are being held in Munich between Britain, France, Italy and Germany in the hopes of negotiating a peaceful end to the Sudeten Crisis.\n\nThe British have refused to back down, and are instead threatening the Germans with war if they violate Czechoslovakia's borders. War may be imminent."
 germany.42.a:0 "We must prepare!"
 germany.42.b:0 "France should stay out of this."
 germany.43.t:0 "France leaves the Allies"
 germany.43.d:0 "The stubborn French have refused to follow our lead in the Sudeten Crisis! They stand by their support of Czechoslovakia, and since we do not they have decided to rescind our mutual alliance. Even now, France is preparing for an imminent war with Germany."
 germany.43.a:0 "Fools! [GER.GetLeader] must be appeased!"
 germany.44.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nFortunately, it looks like the Allies will stand by their earlier promises of support. They have threatened [GER.GetLeader] with war if our borders are violated in the slightest. Despite this, we must prepare for an imminent German attack."
 germany.44.a:0 "Good! Let them come!"
 germany.45.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nThe British cowards have refused to back our sovereignty, but at least the French are sticking up for us! They have abandoned their alliance with Britain and formed a new one with us, promising to support Czechoslovakia against German aggression."
 germany.45.a:0 "Vive la France!"
 germany.46.t:0 "The Munich Diktat"
 germany.46.d:0 "German demands for our territory in the Sudetenland region have become increasingly hostile, and now their forces are massing along our border! A conference is being held in Munich where European leaders are discussing the future of Czechoslovakia, but we haven't been invited.\n\nBoth the British and French have rescinded their earlier promises to support us against German aggression. Their diplomats have made it clear that if we choose to resist the Germans, we do so on our own. Perhaps we have no choice but to surrender the Sudetenland..."
 germany.46.a:0 "This is a dark day for Europe."
 germany.46.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
 germany.47.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British and their Allies have both rejected our rightful claims to the Sudetenland, and they have threatened us with war if we 'violate' the Czech border!\n\nA plan for the invasion of Czechoslovakia has been drawn up, but this will likely trigger a general European war. We must make certain we are ready for this."
 germany.47.a:0 "Time to do this the hard way."
 germany.48.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. The British have seen reason and accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, but the stubborn French are refusing to back down.\n\nThey have abandoned their cooperation with Britain and forged closer ties with the Czechs instead. It looks like we will have to deal with them both at the same time, but at least now the British hopefully won't intervene..."
 germany.48.a:0 "This may work to our advantage."
 germany.49.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nDespite the hopelessness of their situation, the stubborn Czechs are refusing to surrender their territory! We will have to take it by force. An invasion plan has been prepared that will wipe this vile experiment of Versailles off the face of the Earth!"
 germany.49.a:0 "The Czechs must be destroyed."
 germany.50.d:0 "Talks have been held in Munich between the leaders of Germany, Britain, France and Italy to discuss the future of Czechoslovakia. Both the British and French have accepted our claims to the Sudetenland as legitimate, and their previous offers of support to the Czechs have been rescinded.\n\nRecognizing the hopelessness of their situation, the Czechs have surrendered the Sudeten territories to us. Their oppressed German inhabitants will at long last be brought into the Vaterland!"
 germany.50.a:0 "This is a historic day for Germany."
 germany.51.t:0 "First Vienna Award"
 germany.51.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is a cancer tumor in the heart of Europe, and at last the Germans have decided to take decisive action against them. The Sudetenland has already been surrendered to Germany, and now, as a consequence of the Munich Agreement, the Czechoslovakian territory that rightfully belongs to Hungary is to be returned to us."
 germany.51.a:0 "About time!"
 germany.52.t:0 "The Annexation of Zaolzie"
 germany.52.d:0 "Czechoslovakia is falling apart, and we must act quickly to protect territory with significant Polish populations before it can be seized by Germany. Czech ownership of Zaolzie has always been contested by us, and it is time for the region to join our nation."
 germany.52.a:0 "Zaolzie is ours!"
 germany.53.t:0 "The Fate of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.53.d:0 "Not content with stealing the Sudetenland, the Germans have now decided to seize the rest of our nation. Abandoned by our so-called allies, and with our best defenses lost in the Munich Diktat, the situation appears hopeless..."
 germany.53.a:0 "Give in to the Germans."
 germany.53.b:0 "...yet still we must resist!"
 germany.54.t:0 "The Czechs Resist"
 germany.54.d:0 "The Czechs have somehow mustered the courage to fight our occupation of their country. Their best defenses were in the Sudetenland, which is now under our control, so this should be a swift campaign."
 germany.54.a:0 "Prague will soon be ours."
 germany.55.d:0 "The end of Czechoslovakia is at hand, and our forces are marching into Prague at this very moment. With the surrender of the Czechoslovakian military, we have liberated vast quantities of armaments. Their tanks, in particular, should serve our forces well.\n\nBöhmen will be annexed into Germany as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.d_2:0 "Having conquered Czechoslovakia, we must consider the best way to split up these territories.\n\nBöhmen remains German as a protectorate, but what should become of Slovakia? We can set them up as an autonomous puppet state under Jozef Tiso."
 germany.55.a:0 "Set up Slovakia as a puppet state."
 germany.55.b:0 "Partition Czechoslovakia with Hungary."
 germany.55.c:0 "All of Czechoslovakia belongs to the Reich!"
 germany.56.t:0 "The Partition of Czechoslovakia"
 germany.56.d:0 "German forces have entered Prague and the end of Czechoslovakia is imminent. They intend to annex Bohemia into the German Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.d_2:0 "After annexing Czechoslovakia, Germany is intending to retain Bohemia as part of the Reich, but they are willing to let us have Slovakia. Should we agree to this partitioning? It will mean entering a formal military alliance with Germany."
 germany.56.a:0 "Of course! Greater Hungary will soon be a reality!"
 germany.56.b:0 "No, we do not need Slovakia or German friendship."
 germany.57.t:0 "Hungary Rejects Our Offer"
 germany.57.d:0 "The Hungarians have outrageously refused our generous offer to annex Slovakia, claiming they have no interest in the region! We will have to deal with them soon enough. For now, we must come up with a solution to the Slovakian Question."
 germany.57.a:0 "Set up Tiso's puppet government."
 germany.57.b:0 "Annex Slovakia into Germany."
 germany.58.t:0 "The Polish Question"
 germany.58.d:0 "The Reichsministerium of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has done an excellent job, and the people of Germany - indeed, the entire world - has been informed of the injustices our German brethren in Poland are forced to endure. We now have all the justification we need for a war!"
 germany.58.a:0 "Soon Poland will be no more!"
 germany.60.t:0 "The Remilitarization of the Rhineland"
 germany.60.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region! Unless we issue an ultimatum demanding their withdrawal, the treaty will not be enforced."
 germany.60.a:0 "This is an act of war! Rally the British to our side!"
 germany.60.a.tt:0 "§RIf war breaks out, we will suffer a civil war due to our §YDisjointed Government:§!\n"
 germany.60.b:0 "Issue a diplomatic objection."
 germany.61.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French are mobilizing their forces, and seem intent on issuing an ultimatum. If Germany refuses, they are prepared to advance into Germany to deal with this threat. Popular opinion in Britain is against a war, but if we refuse to stand by the French our alliance with them will be dissolved."
 germany.61.a:0 "A war is out of the question."
 germany.61.b:0 "We must stand by France!"
 germany.62.d:0 "Several German divisions recently advanced into the Rhineland, marking the first time since the end of the Great War that Germany has forces positioned west of the Rhine. This is in clear violation of the Versailles Treaty, under which Germany is forbidden from militarizing the region!\n\nThe French seem content to limit their response to this breach to diplomatic objections, and public opinion in Britain is firmly against a war."
 germany.62.a:0 "We will issue an objection as well."
 germany.63.t:0 "Britain Refuses War"
 germany.63.d:0 "The British are refusing to support us against Germany, claiming that the Germans are 'simply walking in their own backyard.' If we go to war with them, it looks like we will be on our own.\n\nPublic opinion in France is against a war, but Germany will only grow stronger and the remilitarization of the Rhineland constitutes a direct threat against our borders. Issuing an ultimatum would be less threatening without Britain on our side. Should we proceed against them alone?"
 germany.63.a:0 "Yes! Germany must be dealt with now."
 germany.63.b:0 "No, without the British we must back down..."
 germany.64.t:0 "Britain Supports Us"
 germany.64.d:0 "Though popular support for a war is lacking in Britain, the British government has recognized the threat posed by the Germans and they have offered us their full support. We will issue a final ultimatum to Germany to withdraw from the demilitarized zone. If they refuse, it is time for our forces to drive deep into Germany and put an end to their tyrannical regime!"
 germany.64.a:0 "Onwards!"
 germany.65.t:0 "France and Britain Mobilize!"
 germany.65.d:0 "The British and French have refused to accept the remilitarization of the Rhineland, calling it an 'unforgivable breach' of the Versailles Treaty. They are mobilizing their forces against us and have issued an ultimatum that our forces back down at once and the Rhineland remains demilitarized, or our nations are at war."
 germany.65.a:0 "We cannot back down! The Reich must be defended!"
 germany.65.b:0 "We are unprepared for this confrontation. We must back down."
 germany.66.t:0 "France Mobilizes!"
 germany.66.d:0 "The British have seen reason and accepted the remilitarization of the Rhineland, but the mad French are refusing to back down! Claiming that this incident constitutes a direct threat against the security of their nation, they are mobilizing their forces and may sweep in across the border at any moment! We are at war!"
 germany.67.t:0 "France Backs Down"
 germany.67.d:0 "The French wisely chose to back down when they realized that their mad enterprise wouldn't enjoy British support. Their forces have been demobilized and war has been averted for now. By golly, that was a close one!"
 germany.67.a:0 "A war now would be madness."
 germany.68.t:0 "France Refuses to Back Down"
 germany.68.d:0 "The French have stubbornly decided to go at it alone against the Germans, and our alliance with them has been rescinded. Yet another European war has broken out due to pointless squabbling. Perhaps it is time for Britain to distance itself from continental affairs again..."
 germany.68.a:0 "Perhaps it was inevitable."
 germany.70.t:0 "The Oster Conspiracy"
 germany.70.d:0 "Believing that [GER.GetLeader] has pushed Germany into a war it cannot win, a group of senior officers within the Wehrmacht have launched a coup! It appears to have been orchestrated by Colonel Hans Oster of the Abwehr, but generals Beck, von Brauchitsch, Halder and Admiral Canaris have also been confirmed as involved!\n\nHeavily-armed men lying in wait in several Berlin apartments have converged on the Reichskanzlei intent on liquidating [GER.GetLeader] and his closest associates. A fierce gun battle is currently raging inside the building."
 germany.70.a:0 "Protect the Führer at all costs!"
 germany.71.t:0 "The Führer is Dead"
 germany.71.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, but not before the dogs managed to kill [GER.GetLeader]! The Führer was found with several dozen gunshot wounds slumped over his desk - working tirelessly for the Vaterland to his last breath, no doubt!\n\nThe surviving conspirators will stand trial for their heinous crime, but for now Germany is at war and a new leader is needed. Who shall be the next Führer?"
 germany.71.a:0 "Herr Himmler will lead us into the future."
 germany.71.b:0 "Herr Göring is the logical choice."
 germany.72.t:0 "The Conspiracy Fails"
 germany.72.d:0 "SS troops and loyal army units rushing to the Reichskanzlei have managed to kill or capture all of the traitor commandos, and [GER.GetLeader] himself led the clean-up effort with his trusty Luger. Miraculously, the Führer emerged from the fighting with only a few scratches.\n\nThe surviving conspirators will pay a steep price for their disloyalty, and [GER.GetLeader] is now even more committed towards prosecuting the current war towards a glorious victory!"
 germany.72.a:0 "Long live the Führer!"
 germany.73.t:0 "The Conspiracy Succeeds"
 germany.73.d:0 "The heavy fighting in the Reichskanzlei has reduced the building to a burning ruin. Despite a large number of SS soldiers rushing to [GER.GetLeader]'s aid, army units loyal to the conspirators joined the fray and proved decisive. The Führer has been confirmed as killed, and the conspirators have successfully stormed all government buildings in Berlin.\n\nA large portion of the Wehrmacht has gone over to the other side, but many officers are still NSDAP loyalists. Who should be leading them?"
 germany.73.a:0 "Death to National Socialism!"
 germany.73.b:0 "Himmler will turn this around!"
 germany.73.c:0 "Göring is our only hope at this point!"
 germany.74.t:0 "Preparing the Ground"
 germany.74.d:0 "The Austrians are yearning to become part of the German Reich, but the stubborn government in Vienna has so far resisted all attempts to bring about a union. We must increase support for fascism in Austria. The Austrian Nazi Party will then become a viable alternative to the ruling austrofascists.\n\nAn Abwehr agent has been made available for an espionage mission. Use him to covertly increase popular support for fascism in Austria."
 germany.74.a:0 "Austria will be ours!"
 germany.75.t:0 "German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.75.d:0 "Despite harsh previous rhetoric against both the people and the ideological leadership of the [Root.GetName], [From.GetLeader] and Germany has now reached out to us, requesting a mutually beneficial research treaty. While exchanging knowledge would help our efforts to develop new tank designs along with promises of other research benefits in the future, there is little doubt considering previous statements that the Germans are doing this for their own sake. Should we go forward with the agreement despite the risk of aiding [From.GetLeader]'s ambitions?"
 germany.75.a:0 "The capitalists are a worse threat to us both."
 germany.75.b:0 "We won't give fascists the weapons to crush the proletariat!"
 germany.76.t:0 "Soviets Accept German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.76.d:0 "Our negotiations with the [From.GetName] have been successful. An agreement has been reached where our nations will aid each other in the development of new armored units, with a possible extension to other research areas in the future."
 germany.76.a:0 "This treaty will be a stepping stone to the future."
 germany.77.t:0 "Soviets Reject German-Soviet Treaty"
 germany.77.d:0 "The [From.GetName] has rejected our suggestion for a treaty aimed at advancing armored unit research in both countries, presumably fearing our superior weapons would be turned against them."
 germany.77.a:0 "They have hardly diminished the risks of it now."
 germany.78.t:0 "German Joint Air Research"
 germany.78.d:0 "As stipulated by the treaty with Germany, some of their special research projects share discoveries with our engineers. A recent breakthrough in radar technology has come to our attention, opening up unexpected opportunities to advance our research in the field."
 germany.78.a:0 "Detecting the enemy is the first step."
 germany.79.t:0 "Ultimatum from Germany"
 germany.79.d:0 "With Greece under the thumb of Germany, [From.GetLeader] has put pressure on our government to join their ranks. The Soviet-German alliance has put us in a position where neutrality is no longer an option, and now an ultimatum has arrived from Berlin demanding we cede our eastern territories to their Soviet allies and join them in the very pact they are using to force our hand.\n\nAlthough we cannot maintain neutrality, there are other options. Seeking support from Britain is one, standing our ground is another. None, however, can secure the future of the republic with certainty."
 germany.79.a:0 "If we work with the Germans, we may find the opportunity to reclaim other land."
 germany.79.b:0 "We can count on British support, and they can count on us."
 germany.79.c:0 "If these despots want to take our home, they have to fight for it."
 germany.80.t:0 "Danzig for Slovakia"
 germany.80.d:0 "The Germans have long had their eyes on Danzig, seeking to unite their territories in Ostpreussen with the rest of the German nation. Diplomats have warned that the day may come when they make us choose between Danzig or war.\n\nSurprisingly, we have been presented with what the Germans consider a more peaceful solution. They offer the newly created state of Slovakia, currently little more than a puppet state under German rule, to us in exchange for Danzig. \nWhat steps the Germans will take if we decline is unknown, but we have been given an opportunity to resolve this conflict with some territorial gains."
 germany.80.a:0 "This is the best offer we'll get."
 germany.80.b:0 "We will not give what is rightfully ours for what they have stolen!"
 germany.81.t:0 "Danzig Ceded for Slovakia"
 germany.81.d:0 "Poland has agreed to the exchange wherein Danzig will be ceded to [GER.GetNameDef], while Slovakia will now be under Polish control. Through this agreement, we have reclaimed Danzig while maintaining cordial, or at least not openly hostile, relations with our eastern neighbor."
 germany.81.a:0 "Germany is one again."
 germany.82.t:0 "[From.GetNameDef] Refuses to give up Danzig"
 germany.82.d:0 "Our generous offer of Slovakian territories to [From.GetNameDef] in exchange for Danzig has been rejected, leaving Danzig in Polish hands. Clearly, [From.GetLeader] does not share our understanding of Danzig as rightfully German territory. \n[Root.GetLeader] is furious, and the diplomatic options for reclaiming Danzig appear to have been exhausted."
 germany.82.a:0 "It may be time to consider other options."
 germany.83.t:0 "Anti-Soviet Pact"
 germany.83.d:0 "With the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany has secured fertile ground for diplomatic means of containing the Soviet menace. However, the pact does not constitute a military alliance, nor does it contain well-defined obligations for the signatories. [From.GetLeader] now seeks to extend the pact to an Anti-Soviet coalition, a binding agreement to join together in war if any signatory enters into a state of war with the Soviet Union.\n\nWhile substantially more dangerous, and likely to bring an end to any diplomacy we still maintain with the Soviets, this is also our chance to ensure that we have strong allies on our side in the case of war."
 germany.83.a:0 "We will stand by Germany and its allies against the Soviets."
 germany.83.b:0 "Anyone could start another world war with such a pact."
 germany.84.t:0 "Call Pact Members to War"
 germany.84.d:0 "Just as we suspected when we signed the Anti-Soviet Pact, we now find ourselves in a state of war with the Soviet Union. It is time for our co-signatories to honor their promise and join us."
 germany.84.a:0 "Our foresight pays off."
 germany.85.t:0 "[From.GetName] Calls Pact Members to War"
